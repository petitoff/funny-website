# Funny Website!

This is my sandbox and a kind of portfolio for what I learned in the field of JavaScript and HTML & CSS.

### Clean JavaScript
The website is entirely based on plain javascript.

## Explore the entire site!
The site has various riddles and games. Many elements are hidden. Also in the source code itself. Discover them all!
> The dev version may contain bugs. For your own convenience and your nerves, I encourage you to use the released version.
